    Master at least one multi-paradigm language.
    Mastering a language gives you a great sense of perspective.
    To do this, you must write a lot of code, read a lot more, and learn the gotchas and best
    practices.
    Ideally the language has a vibrant community, runs a lot of production code and is reasonably en
    vogue.
    Some good candidates are C#, C++, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
    There’s a famous leading question that C++ interviewers like to ask other C++ programming
    candidates,
    "On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest, how would you rank your knowledge of C++?" I hate
    this question.
    And god help anyone who answers a 9-10, because the claws will come out.
    Bjarne Stroustrap himself would rate himself probably an 8 or less.
    The language is simply too complex, too rich, and has evolved too much over time.
    I digress.
